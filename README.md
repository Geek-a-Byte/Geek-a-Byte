### Hi, I am Nazia Shehnaz. Currently a 3rd year UG at MIST,CSE.

> "Being yourself, Believing in yourself" - are the "choices" you need to cherish the rest of your life. You will meet various people in your day to day life. Their personality/story won't reshape your's fully, rather will motivate you to change.But only You decide whom to follow. Just never ever let the "human" die in yourself, be humble, be strong, be courageous, and do not change your whole self for anybody. Fear/shyness wouldn't bring any good to you. SO LIVE EVERY DAY WITH A SMILE OF CONFIDENCE :D.
