I will be the most serious and hard working this time, I will be master in codeforces once in my lifetime, In shaa ALLAH, I will be. May Allah be with me ðŸ™‚ 
- I will stop listening to music
- will stop posting stories or any other posts in facebook
- will use most of the time to practice in cm
- will do every possible contest in codeforces and codechef, will upsolve problems after contest. 
- will solve all the ncpc and icpc questions
- will give my best to be cm next yr
- will try to be in top 50 in the next ICPC (only one chance I have got this time, I won't lose this chance ðŸ™‚ no NOT THIS TIME,)
I CAN DO IT AND I WILL DO IT ðŸ™‚
Just remember you have to regain the trust of your mother. You were her pride but now you are a disgrace, It's a chance, take it, you have to make her proud this time!
